# Getting started

- Install dependencies

```sh
npm install
# or
yarn install
```

- First, run the development server:

```sh
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Also recommended to run

```sh
npm run build
# or
yarn build
```

To ensure you can successfully do a production build of the project. It's recommended (but not required) to close your dev server when running a Next.js build. Most of the time there is no issue but occasionally the build can put your dev server in a weird state that requires a restart.

You should get a nice little report on the command line of all the pages built with green coloured text implying they are small and efficient. We'll try to keep them that way as we develop the project.

- Start application

```sh
npm start
# or
yarn start
```

You should see the demo app available on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
